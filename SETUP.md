# Quick Setup Guide

Follow these simple steps to get your weather app running:

## Step 1: Get Your Free API Key

1. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. After signing up, go to the "API keys" section
4. Copy your API key (it will look like: `abc123def456ghi789...`)

**Note:** This app uses the One Call API 3.0 by default (requires subscription). It will automatically fall back to the free One Call API 2.5 if your API key doesn't have access to 3.0. For basic features, the free tier works perfectly!

## Step 2: Add Your API Key

1. Open `script.js` in a text editor
2. Find this line (line 4):
   ```javascript
   let WEATHER_API_KEY = 'demo';
   ```
3. Replace `'demo'` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   let WEATHER_API_KEY = 'abc123def456ghi789';  // Your actual key here
   ```
4. Save the file

## Step 3: Open the Website

Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser!

**Or use a local server (recommended):**

### Using Python:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000

### Using VS Code:
1. Install the "Live Server" extension
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Click "Open with Live Server"

## Step 4: Search for Weather!

1. Type a city name in the search bar
2. Press Enter or click the search button
3. Explore the weather data!
